# Driver-s-Drowsiness-Sensor-Eembedded Technology-
<br>
A Driver’s drowsiness sensor is a device which detects the drowsiness of the driver during their course of driving. In today’s era there are a lot of accidents happening due to sleepiness of driver or due to the new immature drivers who believe that they can cover a long way in one drive leading to sleepiness. To prevent all this from happening we are planning to make a device which can sense the sleepiness of the driver and then alert them within the specific time.

We are going to use IR sensor, Arduino Uno and a buzzer to make the prototype module. It works well in the prototype version with only drawback being long time exposure of our Eyes to the IR lights.
